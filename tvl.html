			<p>
        The TVL strand or Technical-Vocational-Livelihood strand is one of the strands offered in the senior high school (SHS) program in the Philippines. This strand is designed for students who are interested in pursuing careers in technical-vocational and livelihood fields.
<br><br>
The TVL strand offers a range of subjects that focus on developing practical skills and knowledge in various technical and vocational fields such as agriculture, fishery, automotive, electronics, and hospitality, among others. It includes subjects such as basic electrical and electronics, automotive servicing, cookery, housekeeping, and entrepreneurship.
<br><br>
Completing the TVL strand can prepare students for various career paths such as becoming skilled workers, technicians, and entrepreneurs in different technical-vocational fields. It can also serve as a preparation for further studies in technical-vocational courses or in college or university, especially for courses that require a strong background in technical and vocational skills.
