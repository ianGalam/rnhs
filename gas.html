			<p>
        The GAS strand or General Academic Strand is one of the strands offered in the senior high school (SHS) program in the Philippines. This strand is designed for students who are not yet sure of the specific career or field they want to pursue in college or university.
<br><br>
        The GAS strand offers a broad range of subjects that cover different academic disciplines such as humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and mathematics. It includes subjects such as reading and writing skills, research, statistics, and public speaking. It also offers specialized subjects such as creative writing, Philippine politics and governance, and disaster readiness and risk reduction.
